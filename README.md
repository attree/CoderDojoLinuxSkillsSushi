Linux Skills Sushi Cards
===========
These cards are intended to introduce kids to the Linux CLI and commonly used commands. 

They are saved as both word docs (for editing) and PDFs which I recommend for viewing the cards.

If you want to use the same fonts as the ones on the card you'll need to install Lexia and Droid Sans Mono fonts. You can get these fonts from http://www.k-type.com/fonts/lexia-readable/ 
and 
http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/droid-sans-mono

Fell free to fork this project to add more cards or edit existing ones.

Have fun!
